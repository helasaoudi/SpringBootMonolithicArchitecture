# 🎬 Spring Boot Monolithic Architecture - Movie Ticket Booking Example

This project demonstrates a **Monolithic Modular Architecture** using **Spring Boot**, through a basic **movie ticket booking system**.

## 📌 Project Objective

The goal of this project is to apply and test the **modular monolithic architecture** within a real-world backend example. Each module handles a specific business concern, but everything is deployed as one unified Spring Boot application.

## 🏗️ Architecture

- ✅ **Monolithic**: Single deployable unit  
- 🧩 **Modular**: Organized by domain logic, including:
  - `movie`
  - `user`
  - `booking`
  - `payment`

This structure ensures better code organization and maintainability.

## 🚀 Features

- 🎟️ Ticket booking for movies  
- 🎥 Browse available movies and schedules  
- 👤 User registration and management  
- 💳 Simulated payment processing  

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Java 17**  
- **Spring Boot**  
- **Spring Data JPA**  
- **MySQL** – Relational database  
- **Maven** – Dependency management  

## 🧪 How to Run

1. **Clone the repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/helasaoudi/SpringBootMonolithicArchitecture.git
